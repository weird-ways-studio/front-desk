# front-desk

A small service that lets studio agents ask for narrow, short-lived access, which Ben approves with his passkey (Face ID) on his phone.

- Design: `weird-ways-studio/studio-os` docs/specifications/face-id-access/C4-SPIKE.md
- No secrets live in this repo. Master keys are stored encrypted in the service and unlock only with Ben's passkey.
- Every change to `main` needs Ben's approving review; the service deploys only from `main`.
- Public on purpose: the protection rests on keys and review, not on hidden code (Ben, 2026-10-25).
- Hosting departs from studio ADR 017 (self-host on the c-box) because running off the c-box is the control.
